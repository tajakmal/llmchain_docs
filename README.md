# Langchain Docs Scraper and GPT-4 Q&A Bot
This project demonstrates how to scrape the Langchain documentation, preprocess the text, embed the text using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, store the embeddings in Pinecone, and utilize GPT-4 to answer questions based on the scraped content.

Installation
To install the required packages, run:

Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 tiktoken langchain.text_splitter pinecone openai
Additionally, you need to have API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone. Set up environment variables for both API keys:

OPENAI_API_KEY
PINECONE_API_KEY
Scraping and Preprocessing
We start by scraping the Langchain documentation website and extracting the main content of the website. The code provided will also identify and parse local links within the website for further content extraction.

After scraping the content, we preprocess the text by removing HTML tags, unnecessary whitespace, and replacing HTML entities with their corresponding characters.

Embedding and Indexing
We use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to create embeddings of the preprocessed text. These embeddings will be stored in a Pinecone index to enable efficient vector search.

Before we store the embeddings, we need to create an index in Pinecone using the given API key. We then populate the index with the embeddings created using the OpenAI model.

Retrieval
To search the indexed embeddings, we create a query vector for a given question. Using this query vector, we retrieve the most relevant chunks of text from the Langchain documentation.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Finally, we utilize GPT-4 to generate answers based on the retrieved text. By providing the retrieved context and our original question as input, we obtain an answer generated by GPT-4. This answer takes into account the information provided in the retrieved text.

We can also compare the quality of answers generated with and without the retrieved context.

Usage
Follow the steps below to use the Langchain Docs Scraper and GPT-4 Q&A bot:

Step 1: Scrape and preprocess the Langchain documentation
Run the provided code to scrape the Langchain documentation website and preprocess the text. This will result in a clean dataset ready for embedding.

Step 2: Embed the text and index it in Pinecone
Run the code to create embeddings of the preprocessed text using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model. Then, store these embeddings in a Pinecone index.

Step 3: Perform a search using a query
Create a query related to the Langchain documentation. For example:

graphql
Copy code
query = "How do I use LLMChain in Langchain?"
Use this query to create a query vector and retrieve the most relevant chunks of text from the Langchain documentation.

Step 4: Generate an answer using GPT-4
Feed the retrieved context and your original query into GPT-4 to generate an answer. For example:

lua
Copy code
res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a Q&A bot. A highly intelligent system that answers user questions based on the information provided by the user above each question."},
        {"role": "user", "content": augmented_query}
    ]
)
Display the response nicely using Markdown:

python
Copy code
from IPython.display import Markdown
display(Markdown(res['choices'][0]['message']['content']))
Step 5: Experiment with different queries and settings
Try various queries and compare the quality of answers generated with and without the retrieved context. You can also experiment with different GPT-4 primers to see how they affect the generated answers.
